I'm a US-based Solutions Engineer and indie developer passionate about creating meaningful digital experiences. At TeamDynamix, I specialize in technical enablement and solution demonstrations. Through my indie development studio Crossfades.net, I build web projects focused on health, wellness, and community support.

My notable projects include CHS-Awareness.com, providing compassionate resources for Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome, Sesh-Tracker.com for privacy-focused wellness tracking, and Tim's LifeOS, a personal digital command center. I leverage modern web technologies like React, TypeScript, and Cloudflare's edge platform to create accessible, user-focused solutions.

Beyond development, I'm deeply involved in fostering inclusive online communities through Discord management and organizing various gaming and social events. My development style emphasizes clean design, thoughtful engineering, and a touch of playfulness inspired by indie games.
